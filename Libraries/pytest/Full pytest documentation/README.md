To find out what kind of builtin pytest fixtures exist, use the command:
```pytest --fixtures```

To run pytest, you have the option to specify files and directories. If you donâ€™t specify any files
or directories, pytest will look for tests in the current working directory and subdirectories. It
looks for files starting with `test_` or ending with `_test`.
